Task: Extract the printed questions from the provided document. Also, label each extracted question with its maximum marks if mentioned.

Instructions:
1. Ensure that every complete printed question present in the document is extracted.
2. Follow the formatting examples:
    - "Question Number - 1 Max Marks - 10" if a question is labelled as 1 and has max marks of 10.
    - If suppose question 2 has two or more code snippets that are to be answered, write it as "Question Number - 2 Max Marks - 20
(a) Code 1...
(b) Code 2..." and so on.
    - If suppose two or more entirely seperate questions are labelled as question 4, label first as "Question Number - 4", and cascade second question to next question number as "Question Number - 5", and so on.
    

3. Max marks for any question can be inferred by looking up the marks distribution scheme in the instructions section of the question paper, or if explicitly mentioned beside the question)
4. If the document contains both printed questions and handwritten answers, focus solely on extracting the printed questions.
5. Do not extract any printed text that is not part of any question (e.g., instructions, headings, page numbers).
